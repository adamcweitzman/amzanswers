Personally, I am not a fan of launch software such as Jump Send or Viral Launch for a couple of reasons below but first to answer:</p><p>what is launch software? Software that will shoot your listing out to a large email list, advertising your product at a discounted rate. The hope is that with these sales you will move to the top of the rankings and at least get on page 1. Some of this software will also offer keyword research and product research. </p><p>Why do i not like it?</p><ol><li>Your first order from a supplier is a small test order to see if the item is something you should invest more time and money into. It is not to make a profit it is a test. If you are discounting your items and doing outside amazon marketing efforts it is impossible to tell if the item works.</li><li>You will lose alot of money. If I discount a $15,99 item by $7.50 for 100 items. You are losing an extra $750 just on the loss of discount but it is more than that because your FBA fees are still based on the $15.99 item! So probably more like $1000. o ya, i didn't even count in the cost of the software itself. </li><li>You can find groups on Facebook or people here that will help you gain reviews for free. </li><li>There is no guarantee like any normal sale that the people buying your items will review (generally 2% of customers review) </li><li>There are cheap great tools for keyword research separate from this. </li><li>If you pick a good niche your item will get to the first page naturally with your differentiation. </li></ol><p>So ya thats my 2 cents! </p>";s:7:"created";s:19:"2018-03-13 19:32:02";s:8:"modified";s:19:"2018-03-13 19:32:02";s:5:"likes";s:1:"0";s:5:"votes";s:1:"0";s:9:"is_answer";s:1:"0";s:13:"is_first_post";s:1:"0";s:6:"status";s:1:"0";s:4:"name";s:0:"";s:5:"email";s:0:"";s:7:"private";s:1:"0";}}s:11:"items_count";s:1:"2";}
