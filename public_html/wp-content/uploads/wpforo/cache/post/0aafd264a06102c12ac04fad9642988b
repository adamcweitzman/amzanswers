Dont worry man, the thing with Amazon is that you are definitely going to be confused at first because the first step is also the hardest, finding a nice. Below are some quick strategies you can use to finding your first product:</p><ul><li>Scroll through the best seller list and find items that have under 100 reviews. I have used this countless times to find items. </li><li>Whenever you are in a store or walking around daily write down every item under 1lb that you see or think of. Then later check Amazon and see if any of those items have under 100 reviews and a sales rank of under 8000</li><li>Look at items in Amazon.UK (Great Britain) or Amazon.de (Germany), find items that have under 50 reviews and are under 10000 sales rank. See if they are selling in the USA. Or just look at the best sellers from those markets and see if they are selling in the USA. </li></ul><p>This should give you some good direction to begin. </p><p>Noah</p>";s:7:"created";s:19:"2018-03-15 16:59:58";s:8:"modified";s:19:"2018-03-15 16:59:58";s:5:"likes";s:1:"0";s:5:"votes";s:1:"0";s:9:"is_answer";s:1:"0";s:13:"is_first_post";s:1:"0";s:6:"status";s:1:"0";s:4:"name";s:0:"";s:5:"email";s:0:"";s:7:"private";s:1:"0";}}s:11:"items_count";s:1:"2";}
