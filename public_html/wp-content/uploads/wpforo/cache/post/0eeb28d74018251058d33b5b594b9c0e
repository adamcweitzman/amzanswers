Unfortunately, for Amazon sellers this is very ambiguous as technically if you have sold a fair bit of items you have nexus in all 50 states. Which means to be 100% legal you would need to register for all 50 states and in some states multiple counties. Most Amazon sellers will register in the 4 states that are really cracking down on this, California, Washington, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and of course you should register wherever you live or your company is based. It is a ton of work not only to register but to continuously file every quarter through archaic government websites. hopefully in the near future Amazon will be required to collect sales tax on all purchases and submit the forms themselves. Until then this company can really help to calculate and file your sales taxes for you: </span><a href="https://www.taxjar.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400">https://www.taxjar.com/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.
