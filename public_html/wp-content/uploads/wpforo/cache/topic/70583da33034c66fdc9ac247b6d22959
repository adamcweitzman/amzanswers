Of course they add up but if you have an item that sells at least 2 to 3 a day you can still keep 100’s in inventory and this will be almost negligible. To see your short term storage fees hover over </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">“Reports”</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> then on the left scroll to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">“Monthly Storage Fees” </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">once there request a report for the month you would like to see.

Setup an auto removal that will get rid of the inventory before you are charged any long term fees. You can either have the items disposed of (no charge) or have the items sent somewhere (small charge). To set this up hover over </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">“Settings”</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> in the top right, navigate to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fulfillment by Amazon”</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> and scroll down to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">“Automated long-term storage removals”</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400"> change the setting to what you need. </span></p>";s:7:"created";s:19:"2018-03-06 17:23:06";s:8:"modified";s:19:"2018-03-06 17:23:06";s:5:"likes";s:1:"0";s:5:"votes";s:1:"0";s:9:"is_answer";s:1:"0";s:13:"is_first_post";s:1:"0";s:6:"status";s:1:"0";s:4:"name";s:0:"";s:5:"email";s:0:"";s:7:"private";s:1:"0";}}s:11:"items_count";s:1:"1";}
