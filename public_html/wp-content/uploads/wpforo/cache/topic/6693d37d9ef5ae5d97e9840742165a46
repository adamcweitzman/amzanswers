I am brand new and want to get my feet wet without taking to much risk?";s:4:"body";s:1012:"<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Selling on Amazon can be very profitable but it is not a get rich quick scheme. It is very important to ramp up slowly so you can build knowledge before you increase your financial risk. There is not a perfect product or solution that will analyze product niches for you and automatically pick the best ones. Generally, you are looking for a product under 5000 BSR (Seller Rank which you can see by scrolling to the bottom of a listing) and under 100 reviews. This mean that the product is not very old but is selling very well. Once you find that you will look to make one differentiator that will make someone choose your item instead of the other. When negotiating with a supplier for this item it is important to negotiate the lowest MOQ (Minimum Order Quantity). Keep pushing until you get this to 250 or less units. This will negate the risk and upfront capital you need to expend. This is a very large topic so please let me know if there are other questions. </span></p>";s:7:"created";s:19:"2018-03-06 17:37:27";s:8:"modified";s:19:"2018-03-06 17:37:27";s:5:"likes";s:1:"0";s:5:"votes";s:1:"0";s:9:"is_answer";s:1:"0";s:13:"is_first_post";s:1:"0";s:6:"status";s:1:"0";s:4:"name";s:0:"";s:5:"email";s:0:"";s:7:"private";s:1:"0";}}s:11:"items_count";s:1:"1";}
