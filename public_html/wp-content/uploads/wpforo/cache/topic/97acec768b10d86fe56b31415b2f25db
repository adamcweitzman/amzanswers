Generally, the lower demand niches always work better because there is more room to differentiate and be seen on the first page. Realistically, even if there is incredible demand for a niche, if all of the items on the first page have over 100 reviews it is going to be near impossible for you to be seen and grow the listing.</p><p> </p><p>Also, in high demand niches the top items could have been on there for years and traffic might be coming from an outside paid traffic source. For instance, the top 3 items might be running facebook / google ads to bring traffic and because they convert so well it does not matter the cost. Now if you join that list you are going to have to run ads and increase your initital investment / risk to even compete. </p><p> </p><p>Low demand low competition all day! As long as there is not Zero demand! </p><p> </p>";s:7:"created";s:19:"2018-03-12 18:24:25";s:8:"modified";s:19:"2018-03-12 18:24:25";s:5:"likes";s:1:"0";s:5:"votes";s:1:"0";s:9:"is_answer";s:1:"0";s:13:"is_first_post";s:1:"0";s:6:"status";s:1:"0";s:4:"name";s:0:"";s:5:"email";s:0:"";s:7:"private";s:1:"0";}}s:11:"items_count";s:1:"1";}
