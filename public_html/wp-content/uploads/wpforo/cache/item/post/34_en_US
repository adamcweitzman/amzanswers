Although, prices will definitely be higher, the customer service is far worse, and the MOQ (minimum order quantity) is going to be far higher, and strict regulations may stop the development of certain items. Generally, trying to work with a US supplier will make you appreciate working with one in China. Although you save on shipping costs it will still end up being much more expensive. </p><p>Noah</p><p> </p>";s:7:"created";s:19:"2018-03-15 17:03:58";s:8:"modified";s:19:"2018-03-15 17:03:58";s:5:"likes";s:1:"0";s:5:"votes";s:1:"0";s:9:"is_answer";s:1:"0";s:13:"is_first_post";s:1:"0";s:6:"status";s:1:"0";s:4:"name";s:0:"";s:5:"email";s:0:"";s:7:"private";s:1:"0";s:3:"url";s:98:"https://amzanswers.com/usa-suppliers/where-can-i-find-usa-suppliers-is-this-a-good-option/#post-34";s:11:"is_answered";s:1:"0";s:9:"votes_sum";s:1:"0";s:11:"likes_count";s:1:"0";s:16:"likers_usernames";a:0:{}}
