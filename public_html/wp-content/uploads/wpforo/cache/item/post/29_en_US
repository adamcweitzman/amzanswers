Maybe you know my theory or strategy by now from other posts but when you are just starting off it is always best to avoid most costs and try to bootleg everything. A lot of sellers get caught up in keywords, but there is a very easy way to add good keywords to your listing for free..... scan your top competitors and pick the 30 to 50 keywords that are the most relevant. </p><p>When you do want some more keywords for ads or your listing that your competition may not be hitting try Keyword Tool Dominator which is my personal favorite. </p><p>https://www.keywordtooldominator.com/</p><p>Keyword Tool Dominator just shows you the most popular auto-completes on Amazon. so for instance, lets say I was selling a coffee mug.

Hope that helps! </p><p>Noah</p><p> </p>";s:7:"created";s:19:"2018-03-14 22:20:35";s:8:"modified";s:19:"2018-03-14 22:20:35";s:5:"likes";s:1:"0";s:5:"votes";s:1:"0";s:9:"is_answer";s:1:"0";s:13:"is_first_post";s:1:"0";s:6:"status";s:1:"0";s:4:"name";s:0:"";s:5:"email";s:0:"";s:7:"private";s:1:"0";s:3:"url";s:71:"https://amzanswers.com/keyword-tools/wich-one-do-you-recommend/#post-29";s:11:"is_answered";s:1:"0";s:9:"votes_sum";s:1:"0";s:11:"likes_count";s:1:"0";s:16:"likers_usernames";a:0:{}}
